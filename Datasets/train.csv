Sathi Babu makes his way into her heart and she also starts loving him. Sathi Babu tells her the truth about him being a thief and resolves to give up crime forever. But before that, he decides to swindle one last person for a large sum of money along with his con-friend Duvva (Brahmanandam). He tricks a woman on a railway station (Not really station, it is bus stand) and flees with a trunk. This leads Sathi Babu to Neha (Baby Neha), a young girl who was in the trunk instead of the wealth he thought was in the trunk, who thinks that satibabu is her father. Flummoxed by what is happening, but forced to keep Neha with her as a police officer Inspector Mahanti (Rajiv Kanakala) keeps his eye on him.Although he tries keeping neha away from Neeraja’s eyes, the latter finds out about Neha. Angry and hurt, Neeraja leaves for her place leaving Sathi Babu heartbroken. Soon, unknown goons attack him, taking him to be a latter named ASP Vikram Singh Rathod (also Ravi Teja), Neha’s real father. Rathod looks exactly like Sathi Babu which had caused all the confusion. While many unknown persons help Sathi Babu run to safety with Neha in his arms, he is soon surrounded by the goons. It is then that Rathod makes an appearance and saves the day killing every goon by himself.

There, but for the grace of God, goes Maud, a reclusive young nurse whose impressionable demeanor causes her to pursue a pious path of Christian devotion after an obscure trauma. Now charged with the hospice care of Amanda, a retired dancer ravaged by cancer, Maud's fervent faith quickly inspires an obsessive conviction that she must save her ward's soul from eternal damnation - whatever the cost. Making her feature-film debut, writer/director Rose Glass cannily lures the audience into this disturbed psyche, steadily setting up her veritable diary of a country nurse for an unnerving and ultimately shocking trajectory. Morfydd Clark (also at the Festival in The Personal History of David Copperfield) portrays the sanctimonious Maud with an intense stoicism that belies a disquieting vulnerability, as Maud desperately vies for absolution and solidarity from her embittered patient (an enthralling Jennifer Ehle, also at the Festival in Beneath the Blue Suburban Skies). Glass tenderly captures this relationship with an empathetic gaze that first assumes an ethereal, dreamlike atmosphere - but it isn't long before Maud's dogmatic candor incites an irreconcilable friction that spirals her mind into a suffocating confluence of creeping doubt and paranoia. As Glass tightens the screws on her misguided martyr, well-placed nods are made to religious horror forerunners like William Friedkin's The Exorcist, further contributing to the film's increasingly dread-filled malaise. And when this insidious fever climatically breaks, the consequences are devastating and terrifying in equal measure.",Saint Maud,32155.0,Rose Glass,0

Tracy begins to feel uneasy as they get closer.

Tracy Goodwyn, Director of Books and Documents at the Metropolitan Auction House in New York City, is the last of her art history best friends - Boston museum curator Avery and Chicago university professor Emma the other two - to have possession of the late nineteenth century Italian lace wedding veil they purchased together solely as an antiquity. The legend of the veil is that its owner will come into true love. While the veil seems to have worked with recently married Avery and Emma meeting their respective spouses when they had it in their possession, Tracy is less than skeptical in never really having believed in true love for various reasons, and in she and her musician boyfriend of two years Finn, her longest ever relationship, breaking up out of circumstance while she had the veil, they only having talked casually about the possibility of getting married beforehand. In planning a party at work to publicize an upcoming auction, Tracy meets high end restaurateur Nick Serchio, who she, at the last minute, hires as the function caterer, she reluctant to do so despite the quality of his food as they butted heads in a chance earlier encounter over their strong opposing feelings about New York issues. The one thing each can agree on is their love for the city, Nick, a third generation Italian-American whose love for the city is partly from the immigrant experience of his maternal ""nonna"", Gia. Beyond the auction house party, Tracy and Nick begin to bond in each helping the other with a prominent work issue: Tracy trying to find a museum to purchase an original handwritten draft of Emma Lazarus' ""The New Colussus"" made most famous by being engraved on the Statue of Liberty, it going to auction which would probably mean it being purchased by private buyer Carter Wainwright who would otherwise hide it in a vault, and Nick opening a new Asian-Italian fusion restaurant against Nonna's traditional Italian sensibilities. The question becomes whether romance-shy Tracy will be open enough to let Nick romantically into her life, especially so soon after Finn.",The Wedding Veil Legacy,5127.0,"Sandra Berg, Judith Berg, Lori Wilde",1

As Phil swings between fury and cunning, his taunting of Rose takes an eerie form - he hovers at the edges of her vision, whistling a tune she can no longer play.

Emma Conroy has wanted to be a butler since she was a child being enthralled with the British television show Plumshire Manor depicting its life. As such, she is aiming to get a job in one of the royal estates of Europe. After several unsuccessful applications to many of the butler academies in the US, she bolstering her resume as requested after each of those unsuccessful attempts, she is offered the final spot in this year's class at the prestigious American Butler Academy in Maryland under the tutelage of Charles Willoughby, this only the first step as she learns upon arrival that one-third of her class will not graduate. While she has all the knowledge in her head and is diligent in studying, she is finding that it is like having stage fright in the actual execution in failing time and time again, she seeming to need to find a way to claw her way out of that bottom third. Conversely, Henry Walker, one of her classmates, doesn't even seem to want to be there in being less than meticulous in his attitude - he and Emma butting heads always getting her in trouble in the process - yet he seems to always come out smelling like a rose in having a natural aptitude to the work. Emma learns the reason for Henry doing well is that he is a legacy butler, having come from a line of two hundred years of butlers, but instead of following in his father's footsteps as his father expects, he has other thoughts as a wanted profession, namely to be a chef. Mr. Willoughby suggests that the two work together in each being able to provide a needed perspective and skill that the other does not have toward the work.
