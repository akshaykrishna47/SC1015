Set in a hidden rainforest of Latin America, Koati tells the story of three unlikely friends who embark on a journey to save their home, ""The Land of Xo,"" and along the way discover that anyone, including themselves, can be the hero of their own story. The Land of Xo is where reality and fantasy meet - a place where real forces of nature intertwine with the magic and mysticism of our ancestors and our folklore. Among Xo's least ""important"" inhabitants is an orphaned coati named NACHI - a free-spirited, natural born rebel and loner. As an orphan, Nachi learned to be on his own and fend for himself. He is proud of his street-savvy smarts and doesn't think he needs anybody. Luckily, there are those in Xo who know even loners need a community. They include AMAYA, a quetzal bird and mother figure for Xo's misfit children. And BALAM, a wise black jaguar who is Xo's benevolent leader. Amaya loves Nachi as if he were her own son. Balam treats Nachi like his apprentice, showing him what it truly means to be a leader. When our story begins Xo and its inhabitants are being threatened by a series of devastating earthquakes. Balam gathers his council to advise him on the best way forward. Present at the council's meting is COCOPA, the ancient armadillo and sacred shaman of Xo, and ZAINA, a smart but manipulative coral snake. When Cocopa suggests they stay and protect their land, Zaina feigns diplomacy to Balam, recommending they migrate South and tries to convince him, and others, that Xo is no longer safe. But really, she is power-hungry and only using this crisis for her own gain, wanting a new land that she can rule - not as a wise leader, but as an all-powerful queen. In essence it is Zaina, and not the earthquakes, that might be  dangerous to the future of this community. Unfortunately, before a decision is made another massive earthquake hits Xo. And in a heroic attempt to save lives, Balam is killed, leaving everyone, especially Nachi, devastated and without a leader. Zaina quickly seizes power and uses her seductive charm to persuade the mourning inhabitants to leave Xo and follow her to a new land. Nachi is not fooled by her charm and knows she can't be trusted. So he decides to turn to Cocopa for guidance, knowing it is what Balam would've wanted him to do. But Cocopa's advice is not so cut and dry. He tells Nachi that he must go on a journey to find the answers he seeks. There are those who do follow Zaina and her enormous, albeit tiny-brained henchman, the anaconda JITHU, to a new land. But Nachi takes Cocopa's advice and ventures off on his own quest. Despite his wish to do this journey alone, PAKO, a rambunctious glass frog, appoints himself Nachi's travel buddy. Being a glass frog, Pako is incapable of concealing his feelings - neither physically nor emotionally, which at first annoys Nachi to no end. But ultimately, it is Pako's sentimental nature that helps Nachi open up and let others in. Another initially unwanted tag-along, is XOCHI, a beautiful, precocious monarch butterfly who lacks any social boundaries, but who is utterly fearless. Together, our trio will discover the cause of the earthquakes, find a solution, reunite with their tribe and rebuild The Land of Xo stronger than before. Because anyone - even a coati, a glass frog, and a monarch butterfly, can be the hero of their own story.",Koati,8845.0,"Ligiah Villalobos, Alan Resnick, Rodrigo Perez-Castro",0

While Amelia accepts her responsibility, she has not much liked her lack of freedom over the course of her life in wanting to experience some of it without the strict royal protocols. That experience extends to romance in wanting whatever eventual matrimonial match to be borne not out of royal arrangement but rather out of love, which she feels can only happen in that freedom of experiencing life. In that vein, she wants at least to discover if a connection she made with Chicago-based artist Wes Riverton, who was commissioned to paint her portrait, could be love, the weeks of portrait sittings which only gave each the idea that they are attracted to each other and want to continue to see each other, something that the protective Queen, if she knew, would probably not allow. Under the guise of celebrating with her maternal Uncle Andreas on his birthday in his home base of Beverly Hills, he the Bundbury emissary to the US, Amelia plans to escape the watchful eyes not only of her mother and her uncle while in Los Angeles, but also Grady Beck, the bodyguard her uncle assigns to her, to travel to Chicago to reunite with Wes. While she knows that her secretary Camille is on her side, Amelia is surprised to learn that her uncle is a romantic at heart and allows her to go, unknown to the Queen, with an initially reluctant Grady assigned as her bodyguard/escort/driver. The road trip may provide the Princess exactly what she wants, that freedom, however, showing her a different part of life than she was expecting with Grady as her guide.",A Royal Runaway Romance,4248.0,Jake Helgren,0

While Amy Atwater works on the computer software side of Seattle based Global Explorer, an online outdoor travel magazine, she aspires to  creative work, most specifically photography, which is just a hobby at the moment. When she learns that one of the staff photographers is out of commission for an upcoming article, Amy, with portfolio in hand, is able to convince her editor, Camilla, to give her the assignment on the caveat of sending some preliminary shots within short order for approval to proceed further. That assignment is to photograph the  elusive waterfalls of the Pinewood Lakes area, it uncertain if some of those waterfalls, most specifically Redwood Falls, actually exist or if they are just legends in there being no official records, photographic or otherwise. The difficulty for Amy is that she is not an outdoor type person, she lost without her GPS, let alone no trail markers or trails in some cases. However, she sees this assignment as a metaphor of her life as she has felt she has always been chasing waterfalls. At the lodge in the park, she meets one of the tour guides, divorced Mark North, and his eleven year old daughter, Kyra North, of who he shares custody. Mark is known as the person at the lodge that would know the location of the  elusive waterfalls if they do indeed exist.

Nicky Beaton and Simone Cole have been best friends since they were children growing up as next door neighbors in the town of Marsden. Despite their geographic distance in Nicky now living in New York City, they will be spending both Thanksgiving and Christmas together on Nicky's return for the respective holidays. Those holidays end up not being as either envisioned. After her first husband Ryan abandoned her and their now fifteen year old son Anthony years ago, flower shop owner Simone will imminently be getting remarried, this time to high school classmate Jeremy Winters. While Simone is bracing herself for the arrival back of who she considers Jeremy's overbearing mother Miriam Winters for the holidays, she is ill-prepared for the feeling she has of being shut out of the bonding that is going on between Jeremy and Anthony, especially in wanting that precious time with her son before he goes away to college in three years. And what Nicky believes will be her short Thanksgiving stay in Marsden ends up being extended to Christmas upon news that her parents, Linda and Dave Beaton, are selling the family home, making this holiday season their last in that house. In helping her mother pack up the house, Nicky discovers among her old high school things a never seen Christmas card that was apparently secretly placed in one of her textbooks. The card is truly a love letter from the unknown writer who didn't sign his name. While Nicky is now a successful businesswoman operating her own consulting firm, she has many insecurities from her high school days, and thus goes on a quest, with help from her parents and Simone, to discover who her high school crush was in needing that affirmation that high school was not all bad. While she is focused on that past, she may miss what is currently right in front of her in the form of Derrick Marshall, her parents' real estate agent who is a bigger part of Nicky's past than she realizes.",Open by Christmas,4159.0,"Amyn Kaderali, Christine Conradt",0
