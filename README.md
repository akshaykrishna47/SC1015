# SC1015 Data Science & AI project
### About
This is a project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence).
Our project focuses on a [Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arsalanrehman/movies-dataset-from-piracy-website). The order of files are as follows:

1. [Data Extraction](https://github.com/bombaysus/DSAI-Project/blob/main/Data-Extraction.ipynb) 
    * Extracted the dataset and performed data cleaning 
2. [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/bombaysus/DSAI-Project/blob/main/Exploratory-Data-Analysis.ipynb)
    * Exploreed the dataset using graphs and plots to better understand the data 
3. [Data Resampling and Splitting](https://github.com/bombaysus/DSAI-Project/blob/main/Data-Resampling-and-Splitting.ipynb)
    * Performed various oversampling and undersampling methods 
4. [Linear Regression](https://github.com/bombaysus/DSAI-Project/blob/main/Linear-Regression.ipynb)
    * Used uni-variate and multi-variate linear regression models to predict ratings  
5. [Neural Network-LSTM](https://github.com/bombaysus/DSAI-Project/blob/main/Neural-Network-LSTM.ipynb)
    * Used the LSTM model to predict 'IMDb-rating'
6. [Neural Network-MLP](https://github.com/bombaysus/DSAI-Project/blob/main/Neural-Network-MLP.ipynb)
    * Used the MLP model to predict 'IMDb-rating' 
7. [Random Forest Model](https://github.com/bombaysus/DSAI-Project/blob/main/Random-Forest.ipynb)
    * Used a random forest classifier to predict whether a movie is good 
8. [Slides](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFf9rcu6s8/w6gq4MoB29SS2wjxG27xrQ/edit utm_content=DAFf9rcu6s8&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)
    * Summarises our project and our findings 
  

### Problem Defintion 
Are we able to predict which factors are the most influential in getting people to watch a movie?

Which model would make the best prediction?

### Models Used 
1. Linear Regression 
2. Neural Network - MLP 
3. Neural Network - LSTM 
4. Random Forest 

### Conclusion 
Using the MLP model, we noticed that downloads affected the IMDb rating the most. An interesting insight we had was that the MLP algorithm provided us with the most accurate results. This shows that the MLP neural network should be used for cases like this.

### What we learnt from this project 
We learnt how to clean, process, take samples and run tests on the dataset. Moreover, we learnt to recognise which algorithm should be used for what cases. For example, Random Forest is more suitable for catagorial variables. Lastly, we learnt how to check the accuracy of our models, which will allow us to ensure the quality of our research in the future.
