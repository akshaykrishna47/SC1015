# SC1015 Data Science & AI project
### About
Our project utilises the movies dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arsalanrehman/movies-dataset-from-piracy-website.

### Problem Defintion 
Are we able to predict which factors are the most influential in getting people to watch a movie?

Which model would make the best prediction?

### Models Used 
1. Linear Regression 
2. Neural Network - MLP 
3. Neural Network - LSTM 
4. Random Forest 

### Conclusion 
Using the MLP model, we noticed that downloads affected the IMDb rating the most. An interesting insight we had was that the MLP algorithm provided us with the most accurate results. This shows that the MLP neural network should be used for cases like this.

### What we learnt from this project 
We learnt how to clean, process, take samples and run tests on the dataset. Moreover, we learnt to recognise which algorithm should be used for what cases. For example, Random Forest is more suitable for catagorial variables. Lastly, we learnt how to check the accuracy of our models, which will allow us to ensure the quality of our research in the future.
